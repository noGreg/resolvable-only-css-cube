The objective of this project is to start with a simple Rubik Cube rotating in 3D, after that... 

- Reduce repetitive HTML tags with functional CSS as much as possible (if possible xD)
- Make it fully rotable with parts (face down, face up, face left, etc.)
- Add recognizable completed faces for the cube to get armed from randomized positions (if possible... that's what's we're going to realize in this project)
